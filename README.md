    Gatsby's hello-world starter
  </h1>

  Kick off your project with this hello-world boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

  _Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

  ## üöÄ Quick start

  1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

      Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

      ```shell
      # create a new Gatsby site using the hello-world starter
      gatsby new my-hello-world-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
      ```

  1.  **Start developing.**

      Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

      ```shell
      cd my-hello-world-starter/
      gatsby develop
      ```

  1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

      Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

      Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries).

      Open the `my-hello-world-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

  ## üöÄ Quick start (Netlify)

  ## üßê What's inside?

  A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a typical Gatsby project.

      .
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

  1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

  1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

  1.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

  1.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

  1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

  1.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

  1.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

  1.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

  1.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

  1.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
